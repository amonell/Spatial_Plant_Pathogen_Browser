# Arabidopsis Spatial Plant Pathogen Atlas Data Browser

This repository contains the code for the [Arabidopsis Spatial Plant Pathogen Atlas](http://neomorph.salk.edu:9001/), an interactive data browser for exploring spatial gene expression data related to plant-pathogen interactions.

## Features
- Visualize gene expression across tissues and infection stages in both single cell spatial transcriptomics and RNA+ATAC snMultiome.
- Search and filter data for specific genes or conditions.
- Uses [cellxgene](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/) for easy data exploration.
